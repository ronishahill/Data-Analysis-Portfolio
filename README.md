**Technology:** Tableau & Microsoft Excel

### Prescription Label Translation

**Goal:** To improve the saftey of medication labels translated and dispensed by the Seattle Children's Hospital Retail Pharmacy to non-English speaking patients

**Description:** The data used for this projects included 35 of the most common prescription order statements used by Seattle Children's Retail Pharmacy. They were then to be translated into 6 languages (Spanish, Amharic, Somali, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Vietnamese) and validated against exsiting translations provided by a third-party vendor used by the pharmacy for errors and inconsistencies. 

**Findings:** It was found that compared to our translations, the vendor's translations were long and overly complicated. Due to the size of the prescription labels and containers, the order sentences needed to be short and concise. Also, the mistranslation of these sentences could possibly lead to adverse events such as overdose or death. After a final analysis, it was recommended by our team that the pharmacy either: A) Stopped using the vendor or B) Work with the vendor to implement some of our shorter more concise translations. Our finding were then developed into a 45 page written report along with a visual and submitted to the Seattle Children's pharmacy informatics team.

**Skills:** Logical Functions (Google Sheets), Graphs & Charts (Gantt Charts), Project Planning, Project Management 

**Technology:** Google Suite (Google Sheets, Google Docs)
